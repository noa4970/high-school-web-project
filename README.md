# High School Project ‚Äì Wig Salon Showcase Website (2022)

This website was developed as part of my first year in the computer science program during high school.  
It is a **branding showcase site** for a wig salon, built using **ASP.NET Web Forms (C#)**.

## ‚ú® Project Purpose

The site is designed to reflect the atmosphere and values of the wig salon.  
It features:

- A **home page** with a short introduction to the salon
- A **gallery of wigs** showcasing styles and quality
- Informational **"About", "Price list", and "Contact"** pages (non-functional)
- Hebrew layout and styling tailored for local audience
- Clean, aesthetic, and responsive design with branding in mind

üìå This is a **static site** ‚Äì it does not include shopping, form submissions, or backend logic.

- Designing layout and navigation for user experience

I‚Äôm proud of it as my first real software project ‚ù§Ô∏è
